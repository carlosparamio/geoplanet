= geoplanet

A Ruby wrapper for the Yahoo! GeoPlanet APIs. It's inspired on Mattt Thompson's yahoo-geoplanet gem,
but this version supports better usage of matrix and query parameters, uses JSON for API communication to minimize bandwidth usage, supports both short & long versions of a place, and supports multiple languages.


== INSTALL:

  gem install geoplanet


== Usage

=== Searching for a Location:

  require 'geoplanet'
  GeoPlanet.appid = [Your App ID Here]

  # Search for places that matches "Springfield" (the API returns 1 by default)
  GeoPlanet::Place.search("Springfield")

  # Search for *all* places that matches "Springfield"
  GeoPlanet::Place.search("Springfield", :count => 0)

  # Search for "Toronto" with focus on "Canada"
  GeoPlanet::Place.search("Toronto", :focus => "ca")

  # You can pass in any Matrix or Query parameters this way too
  # For more details see the following URLs:
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#matrix_parameters
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#query_parameters

=== Initializing by Where On Earth ID && Associations

  require 'geoplanet'
  GeoPlanet.appid = [Your App ID Here]

  a = GeoPlanet::Place.new(752067) # WoE ID for Algeciras

  # Everything you get back from the API you have direct access to
  # through the Place object. For example:

  a.version          # "long"
  a.placetype        # "Town"
  a.placetype_code   # 7
  a.admin1           # "Andalucia"
  a.admin1_code      # "ES-AN"
  a.admin1_placetype # "Autonomous Community"
  a.admin2           # "Cadiz"
  a.admin2_code      # ""
  a.admin2_placetype # "Province"
  a.latitude         # 36.127602
                     # Latitude and Longitude are values at Centroid
  a.bounding_box     # [[36.109779, -5.47725], [36.164268, -5.43527]]
                     # Bounding box are SW / NE coordinates in array
  a.pop_rank         # 11
                     # Code representing population size
  a.area_rank        # 4
                     # Code representing the size of the place
                     # See codes at http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/api_docs.html

  # We unlock the true power of GeoPlanet with association collections
  # Check out this truly amazing stuff:

  # A list of other towns in the area
  a.siblings

  # A complete hierarchy, from country down to municipality
  a.ancestors

  # All descendants for a location
  a.descendants(count: 0)

  # Postal Codes at Algeciras
  a.children(:select => "long", :type => 11)

  # You can use multiple types on the same query.
  # e.g. Country and Province for Algeciras
  a.belongtos(:type => [12, 9])

  # You can specify the language you want for the results.
  a.belongtos(:type => 12, :lang => 'es_ES').first.name  # España

  a = GeoPlanet::Place.new(752067, :lang => :es)
  a.country  # España

  # It is also possible to query for any association directly using a WOE ID, without
  # create a Place object. Append a '_of' suffix to the association name to build the
  # method name to execute. The first argument is the WOE ID.

  GeoPlanet::Place.belongtos_of(752067, :type => [12, 9])

=== Debug Mode

If you want to look at the requests that are being executed against the Yahoo GeoPlanet API, you can enable the debug mode. It uses the standard output.

  GeoPlanet.debug = true
  GeoPlanet::Place.new(752067, :lang => :es)
  # outputs:
  # Yahoo GeoPlanet: GET http://where.yahooapis.com/v1/place/752067?appid=[your_appid]&format=json&lang=es
